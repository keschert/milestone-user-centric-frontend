                <h2>What are the different ways to sell my property in Brighton & Hove?</h2>

                
                    
                        <p>There are many ways to sell your property in Brighton and Hove, including using a local
                            estate agent, uploading your
                            property to an online portal, or just rolling the dice and sticking it into an auction. But
                            what about when you need to
                            sell your house quickly? The Brighton Property Company can help speed up the process by
                            offering you a fair cash offer
                            without the lengthy (and stressful!) process of selling your home traditionally on the open
                            market.</p>

                        <p>Our process is simple. We provide a fast, efficient service for homeowners who want a
                            guaranteed quick sale for their
                            home in the Brighton and Hove area without dealing with endless viewings, expensive fees,
                            and buyers pulling out at the
                            last minute. We also buy houses in as-is condition so you don’t have to spend any money on
                            fixing up your home ready for
                            putting it on the market.</p>

                        <p>If you need a quick property sale then The Brighton Property Company could be the right
                            option for you. Complete our
                            interactive quote tool to see how much you could get for your property today. </p>

                <h2>How long does it usually take to sell my house in Brighton & Hove?</h2>
                
                        <p>In today’s political climate, the property market in Brighton & Hove can be unpredictable and
                            we’ve started to notice
                            properties taking longer to sell than they usually would. It’s not uncommon for properties
                            in Brighton & Hove to take
                            over 6-9 months to sell, and this doesn’t even include property chain breaks or buyers
                            pulling out before exchanging
                            contracts.</p>

                        <p>The service we provide takes away any uncertainty in the sale of your property and allows you
                            to move forward with your
                            life without any stress or complications. We even appoint Brighton & Hove’s top conveyancing
                            solicitors to work on your
                            behalf at a timescale that suits you – and we cover the cost!</p>

                        <p>Contact us today to discuss your property situation and see how we can help.</p>

                <h2>How do I sell my house fast in Brighton & Hove?</h2>
                <p>Putting your house into an auction is one way of getting a quick sale for your property in Brighton & Hove and we
                    regularly recommend this to homeowners. However, one of the great things about selling your property to The Brighton
                    Property Company is that we can usually buy your house even quicker than a buyer at an auction can, plus we don’t charge
                    the fees required to sell a property at auction. When you sell to us you’ll know exactly how much cash you’ll be getting
                    for your property on day one, and your future won’t be dictated by which buyers are in the auction room on that
                    particular day.</p>
                    
                    <p>Once you get in touch with us and let us know about your situation we’ll make you a bespoke offer based on exactly what
                    you need. If you decide to proceed with selling your house to The Brighton Property Company we’ll send out an agreement
                    for you to sign and instruct your solicitor (which we pay for) to continue the process and look after you legally. We’ll
                    then aim to get the cash in your bank account in under 30 days.</p>

                        your property. You could have the cash in your bank and be moving on with your life in no time.</p>

                        <p>We work with people throughout Brighton & Hove in a range of different circumstances. Perhaps you’re relocating for
                        work, splitting with your partner, have inherited an unwanted property or just need to release some equity; whatever the
                        reason, we can help.</p>

                <h2>How much is my Brighton & Hove property worth?</h2>
               
                        <p>The key to establishing what your house in Brighton & Hove is worth is by looking at what similar houses in your area
                        have sold for within the last 6-12 months. Websites like Rightmove and the Land Registry are a great place to find out
                        this information. Simply head to the ‘Sold house prices‘ page on Rightmove and enter your postcode. This will show you
                        exactly what the actual sold prices are of the properties in your area and will help you determine an accurate valuation
                        for yours. It’s important to look at sold prices as opposed to what properties are being marketed for as this helps you
                        find the prices that buyers are willing to pay, and not just what sellers in your area are hoping to achieve.</p>
        
                        <p>This is the exact method Brighton & Hove Home Buyers use to determine how much your house is worth so we can formulate
                        our offer. If you’re interested in receiving an offer for your Brighton & Hove property then just complete our quick and
                        easy quote tool (add link to our Typeform questionnaire) to see how much we could pay you.</p>
