            <h2>What do you need to know? Most common questions from our clients:</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>How quickly will you make an offer on my property?</li>
                <p>Once we’ve had a look at your property online we will contact you within 24 hours with our offer. If
                    possible, we like
                    to speak to homeowners over the phone as it helps us get a better understanding of your situation,
                    which helps us come
                    up with an offer that works best for you.</p>

                <li>How do you work out the value of my property?</li>
                <p>We work out the market value of your property by seeing what other properties (similar in size to
                    your house) are
                    selling for in your area. This will allow us to make an initial offer. We’ll then arrange to visit
                    your property to see
                    what condition it’s in before formalising our offer.</p>

                <li>What happens after I agree to sell?</li>
                <p>Once we’ve agreed to purchase your property we’ll handle the process as much as we can.

                    We’ll instruct both of our solicitors to carry out the basic conveyancing process (that’s the legal
                    transfer of the
                    property from you to us) and they’ll take care of all of the paperwork.

                    All you’ll really need to do is sign the contract that comes through the post and answer some basic
                    enquiries about the
                    property. We try and make it as hassle-free as possible.</p>

                <li>How quickly will I receive the cash for my property?</li>
                <p>Once we’ve agreed a price for your property it usually takes around 30 days to get your money. That
                    being said, we are
                    able to work on a case by case basis depending on how quickly you need to move.</p>

                <li>Do you charge any fees or costs?</li>
                <p>We don’t charge fees and we’ll even cover your legal fees if you use one of our recommended local
                    solicitors.

                    Keep in mind that you won’t have any estate agency fees either, so by selling your house to us you
                    know that the price
                    we offer for your property is the full price you’ll receive.</p>

                <li>Who deals with the paperwork?</li>
                <p>We leave the paperwork to the people who do it best – the solicitors.</p>

                <li>Is your service confidential?</li>
                <p>Compared to selling through an estate agent our whole process is completely discreet; there are no
                    for-sale boards, no
                    local advertising, no Rightmove listings, etc. We’ll purchase your property with zero hassle.</p>

                <li>What types of properties do you buy?</li>
                <p>We’re interested in all types of property, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Residential houses and flats</li>
                    <li>Commercial buildings (pubs, office blocks, etc)</li>
                    <li>Plots of land (farmers fields, large gardens)</li>
                    <li>Student houses</li>
                    <li>Probates</li>
                    <li>Hotels</li>
